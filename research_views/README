Menu paths and access callbacks to embed research_views
This tiny module was created to avoid using default views arguments
to specify the researcher uid (ie to secure view) and to hide the menu entry
for non researchers

Dependent on 'repo_researcher' feature as uses view defined 'therein'

The advantage of this module is that it shows a differentiated view for the user/research tab dependent on who is looking at it. This could probably be achieved with context instead, which might be preferable in the future, not yet sure how to show/hide/change primary tab on user page depending on context as well as doing the same for a 'my-research' main menu entry.


It could easily be extended to allow for more complex access control.
